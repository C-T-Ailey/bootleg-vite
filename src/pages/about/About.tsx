        <div><p>In the summer of 2016, a bored 20-something decided to make some mixtapes. Nothing serious, really - just a few prop replications, a couple of bootleg soundtracks, maybe a handful of custom record sleeves.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>Then in the summer of 2022, that bored now-30-something decided to learn how to code -- and along with some friends, Bootleg Bill's Unofficial Audio Rarities was born. A few years of independent work later, I'm proud to present its latest and greatest incarnation.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>It's important to note that, while this is/will be a functional online music store in virtually every respect, there are no actual tapes, records or shirts for sale here. I would love to, but until the muddy waters of copyright and intellectual property have cleared a little, Bootleg Bill's Unofficial Audio Rarities will remain a shrine to the pop culture media which inspires me.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>Now, that's not to say there's nothing to do here. You might have noticed the radio player in the corner - the DJ is a little too preoccupied with finding the station's lost tape to play anything right now, but it's got to be around here somewhere. If you find it, I'm sure she'll be glad to get right back to spinning the reels.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>But that's not all! While you might not be able to physically purchase anything in the store that might happen to catch your eye, anything you "buy" will be added to your account's collection and made available to enjoy at your leisure over at Radio 404. Always keep an eye out for anything which looks out of place, though - who knows what else you'll find?</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>So hang around, explore, vibe for a while - and if you happen to discover a new favourite something-or-other from among the collection, well, nothing would make me happier.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div>Enjoy your stay!</div>
