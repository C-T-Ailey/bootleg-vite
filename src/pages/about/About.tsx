        <div><p>In the summer of 2016, a bored 20-something decided to make some mixtapes. A replication here, a bootleg soundtrack there, maybe one or two custom record sleeves along the way.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>Then, in the summer of 2022, that bored now-30-something decided to learn how to code and along with some friends Bootleg Bill's Unofficial Audio Rarities was born. A few years of independent work later, I'm proud to present the latest and greatest incarnation of my Unofficial Audio Rarities.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>It's important to note that, while this is a functional online music store in virtually every respect, there are no actual tapes, records or shirts for sale here. I would love to be able to, but until the muddy waters of copyright and intellectual property have cleared a little, Bootleg Bill's Unofficial Audio Rarities will remain a shrine to the pop culture media which inspires me.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>Now, that's not to say there's nothing to do here. You might have noticed the radio player in the corner - the DJ is a little too preoccupied with finding the station's lost tape to play anything right now, but it's got to be around here somewhere. If you find it, I'm sure she'll be glad to get right back to spinning the reels - and she might even throw something extra your way as thanks.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>If you happen to have some "cash" burning a hole in your virtual pocket, take a look at the store! Tapes and records you "buy" will be added to your collection, which can be enjoyed at your leisure courtesy of our friend at Radio 404. You'll also notice a few spaces in the store which aren't quite right - Just like the radio tape, these items have gone AWOL. If you should find them, just take them back to the store and you'll be rewarded for your trouble.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div><p>So hang around, explore, vibe a while - and if you should happen to discover a new favourite something-or-other from among the collection, well, nothing would make me happier.</p></div>
        <br/>
        <div>Be excellent to each other!</div>
